# Android / Kotlin: Youtube Video Listing App

This application allows to list Youtube videos and categorize them into different categories defined by the app administrator. 
The app backend is based on the Parse Server open source technology initially created by Facebook.


The application requires the permission "INTERNET" and "ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" in order to access the online backend database hosting data about video categories and videos listed inside the app.

This app uses Parse Server App backend hosted in the Back4app Platform.
So, added videos will be directly accessible to the app users without needing any app update.
