In this app (Youtube Video Listing App) the app admin lists some selected videos from Youtube and categorizes them inside the app. So, it is a kind of Youtube Video catalog having an online cloud backend based on Parse Server. Then, the app users can easily browse the listed videos inside the App.

This mobile app is a Demo of the capstone project of our online free course entitled â€œBuild a Youtube Listing App using Kotlin & Parse From Scratch and Step by Step"

The current version of the demo application contains some videos of our Club called "The Creative Team"
We will successively add many interesting and useful Tutorials and free online courses.
